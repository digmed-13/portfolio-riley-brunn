					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>While I currently reside in Orlando, I was born and raised on the east coast of Florida. Growing up, I had a dual fascination
						with both the arts and various scientific disciplines. Cultivating a diverse range of
						knowledge, I've studied technology, biological sciences, business, and the fine arts
						throughout my academic career. I have a passion for both the design and technical aspects
						of web and mobile apps, and am hoping to share this with others in my future work and career.</p>
